# GPT generation client for AI sites

## Brief introduction

This application uses LLM wrappers but uses Flask to host the LLM locally & globally and make it usable within other AI sites.

I do not condone acts which go against the LLM provider's TOS.

## Supported Sites:

- Any site which uses the ``"/chat/completions"`` route for generation

## Prerequisites

Python (**ONLY 3.10 SUPPORTED**)

Have unzipped the directory to a folder

## Installation of Modules

1. Run the ``install_requirements.bat`` file. This will auto-install everything for you. (simply double-click it)

2. Alternatively, open ``cmd.exe`` in the directory where all the files are and write ``pip3.10 install -r requirements.txt``

## Running the server

1. After the modules are installed, double click the ```app.py``` file.

2. Alternatively, you can double click the ``start.bat`` file to run the server.
3. The cmd should look something like this if everything works:

4. In the API settings, select ``OpenAI`` and ``Reverse Proxy``
5. Copy that URL (it's a local URL, don't worry, it's only accessible from devices in the same network and isn't public)
6. Insert that URL to the AI site ([Venus Chub AI](https://venus.chub.ai) for reference)

## Check Proxy

1. If your settings look alike, press the ``"Check Proxy"`` button. ![CHECK_PROXY_BUTTON](https://i.imgur.com/7L2KqfN.jpg)

2. If everything worked, you should get a green checkmark.

## For mobile users

1. You dont need to install anything
   
2. Simply head to this [google colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WIHWe2w_i-Lg2efd7jLIWEN_319017rJ?usp=sharing) (also works on pc)

## Some more information

1. No, this does not utilize your pc's resources as a LLM.

2. This supports **Venus Chub's** group chat feature.

3. I have no influence over the ``gpt4free`` module and any errors that occur from it are unfixable by me.

4. The ``Chat Memory`` function does not seem to work at the moment.
