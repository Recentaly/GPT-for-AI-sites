## Supported Sites:

[Venus Chub AI](venus.chub.ai)

## About other sites:

- [JanitorAI](janitorai.com) only seems to work partially. it's success is never guaranteed. There seem to be issues with authorization, might rework soon.
- [Harpy Chat](harpy.chat) Does NOT work at all. There seems to be a completely unfamiliar error occuring during generation on their end and not mine.

2. Set the current directory to the root of the folder. Comamnd: ```cd "path_to_folder"```
